Description:
This script contains various functions for analyzing network topologies, generating traffic demands, 
and visualizing network structures. The functions use the NetworkX library for graph-related operations 
and Matplotlib for visualizing network topologies. The script can load network graphs from .graphml files, 
compute topological characteristics, perform routing, and display results, including link loads and capacity.

Functions:
- calculate_topological_characteristics: Calculates and optionally prints the network's topological features.
- display_routing_results: Displays routing statistics, link loads, and wavelength usage.
- generate_random_demand: Generates random traffic demands with paths based on precomputed shortest paths.
- load_generated_graphs: Loads .graphml files from a given folder into NetworkX graph objects.
- load_networks_from_folders: Loads .graphml files from multiple folders.
- filter_random_networks: Filters graphs to limit the number of networks per node count.
- visualize_random_network: Visualizes the network topology with node labels and edge distances.

Dependencies:
- numpy
- networkx
- matplotlib
- random
- os
