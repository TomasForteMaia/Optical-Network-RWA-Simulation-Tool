# Optical Network Routing and Wavelenght Assignment Simulation-Tool

A Python-based simulation tool for **Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA)** in optical networks. This tool was developed as part of a master's thesis in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico. It supports **multi-band optical networks**, **power optimization**, and **physical layer impairments modeling** such as ASE noise and nonlinear interference (NLI).

## Features

- Simulation of **static and dynamic traffic** in optical networks
- Support for **C, L, Super C, Super L bands** and their combinations
- **Power optimization** considering ASE and NLI contributions
- **SNR calculation** after each span, with ROADMs support
- Multi-band ASE noise computation for **contiguous and non-contiguous bands**
- **Routing and wavelength assignment (RWA)** algorithms with blocking analysis
- Plots of network performance metrics: **network capacity, blocking ratio, SNR, and reach**
