This module implements wavelength assignment and SNR verification for an optical network.

Description:
This file contains functions for managing and simulating traffic demands in optical networks. 
The functions handle both static and progressive traffic scenarios with the ability to assign wavelengths, 
account for modulation formats and SNR thresholds, and calculate network performance metrics like blocking ratio and capacity.
